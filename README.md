Getting Started With Git and GitHub
===================================

Explaining Git and GitHub. Forked from [Jaime Kosoy](https://github.com/jkosoy). The following commands below are to be run in the Terminal.App for Mac OSX or Linux. For a good overview on how to use the Terminal see [this tutorial](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). There is also a [desktop application](desktop application) for GitHub if you'd prefer to not use the Terminal.App.

## Some links for more in depth learning

* [The Git Book](http://git-scm.com/book) Explains everything that's possible with git in lots and lots of detail.
